```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js && open index.html
```

Sound requires http, so use a server like the VSCode Live Server extension if you want audio. 

LLMs used throughout for small questions and to write all of Index.html. This was an Elm learning project and I didn't want to do a bunch of js.
